# <Horiseon Homepage>

## Description

This homepage was made to advertise Horiseon's marketing offerings to potential customers. I built this website so that Horiseon could have effective communication of its offerings to potetial customers. The website allows the user to jump to different sections of the webpage from the header to access more specific information on Horiseon's offerings.

## Usage

The only interactable protion of the webpage is the header. In the header you can click the links of "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Maanagement", and "Social Media Marketing" to jump down the page where those topics are covered more in depth.
