# <Horiseon Homepage>

## Description

This homepage was made to advertise Horiseon's marketing offerings to potential customers. I built this website so that Horiseon could have effective communication of its offerings to potetial customers. The website allows the user to jump to different sections of the webpage from the header to access more specific information on Horiseon's offerings.
